## Project Choice (Tell us which project you're doing!)
<h2>Floating Shoe</h2>
<p>I decided to make a game like a flappy bird game, I think that this kind of game will help me improve my skills in coding, not that complicated so I can be able to complete the project on time and gain more knowledge like canvas and be familiar with it.</p>

## Project Description
Floating Shoe is a game where you as a player will be a flying shoe and you need to avoid the feets that are trying to get into you as you move forward.
